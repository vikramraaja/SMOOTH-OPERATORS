## Problem Statement:
Optimizing Doctor Availability and Appointment Allocation in Hospitals through Digital Technology and AI Integration.

## Description:
To develop a digital system that streamlines the appointment scheduling process in hospitals by automating the process of identifying doctor availability and appointment slot allocation. The system will utilize advanced technologies such as face detection, proximity of Mobile phone, or any other relevant technology to detect the presence of doctors in the hospital. The system will use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to allocate appointment slots based on the doctor's presence and the number of waitlisted patients. This will improve the overall patient experience by reducing the wait time. In conclusion, the proposed digital system will improve the efficiency and convenience of the appointment scheduling process in hospitals; the patients will benefit with reduced waiting time.

## Proposed Solution:
Implement a digital system integrating face detection and mobile proximity technology to track doctor presence in real-time. Utilize AI algorithms to analyze doctor availability patterns and allocate appointment slots efficiently.

## Solution Approach Overview:
### Real-time Doctor Presence Tracking:
1. **Proximetric Detection (Mobile Device Signals):**
   - Integrate proximetric detection using mobile device signals (e.g., Bluetooth, Wi-Fi) to complement tracking for more granular location tracking.
   - Utilize mobile devices carried by doctors (e.g., smartphones, tablets) emitting Bluetooth or Wi-Fi signals to determine their proximity to specific areas or rooms within the hospital.
2. **Face Detection Technology:**
   - Implement face detection technology using OpenCV and proximetric detection for additional verification of doctor presence.
   - Install cameras at key locations within the hospital to capture and analyze faces of doctors entering specific areas or rooms.

### Implementation Steps:
1. **Proximetric Detection Integration:**
   - Develop a system to monitor mobile device signals (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi) emitted by doctors' devices to determine their proximity to specific areas or rooms.
   - Use signal strength and triangulation techniques to estimate the location of doctors within the hospital environment.
2. **Face Detection Implementation:**
   - Install cameras equipped with face detection capabilities (using OpenCV) at entry points or key areas to capture and identify doctors' faces.
   - Integrate face detection data with proximetric detection systems to verify doctor presence and enhance location tracking accuracy.
3. **Data Fusion and Analysis:**
   - Integrate data from proximetric detection systems, and face detection cameras to generate comprehensive real-time location information for each doctor.
   - Apply algorithms for data fusion and analysis to optimize doctor presence tracking and provide accurate updates on doctor availability and location.
4. **User Interface and Notifications:**
   - Develop a user-friendly interface within the mobile app for hospital staff to view real-time doctor locations, verify presence, and coordinate patient care efficiently.
   - Implement notifications and alerts based on doctor proximity and availability to streamline appointment scheduling and improve communication.
